ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Teresa Laura!

I studied Industrial Engineering and I have always been interested in technology.

In 2022 I started my journey in the digital marketing world, where I discovered the importance of data, which particularly caught my attention. After that, I decided to start the data science bootcamp at Henry to deepen my knowledge in this area.

Currently, I am continuing to expand my skills in data science and aim to contribute to organizations with my experience and expertise. My goal is to leverage my background in digital marketing and data science to provide valuable insights and support data-driven decision-making processes.
